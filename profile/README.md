The mission of the **BraiNAVLab** is investigating and modeling the **brain structure and function**, as well as their associations with the underlying genetic determinants relying on statistical/machine and deep learning methods. The main current research activities focus on modeling **structural/functional/effective connectivity, brain microstructure, imaging genetics and brain computer interfaces (BCI)**.

Regarding ML/DL, the focus is on **explainable**, methods allowing to open the box and decrypt the outcomes of the algorithms. The lab activities cover a wide spectrum of applications ranging from neurosciences to translational, with particular emphasis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosys and stroke. The lab is also actively participating to the activities of international standardization initiatives that is ISO/IEC JTC1 within the JPEG DNA IG and DICOM WG32.
